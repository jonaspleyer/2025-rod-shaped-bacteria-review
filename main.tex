    Rod-shaped bacteria are ubiquitous forms of life which can be found in diverse microenvironments
    encompassing a wide, diverse range of species.
    Their elongated shape plays a crucial role in many biological processes such as enhancing
    swimming capabilities or promoting surface interactions.
    A key question is how the individual behaviour of multiple bacteria can lead to emergent
    spatial phenomena such as swarming and biofilm formation.
    Mathematical and computational methods provide powerful tools which allow researchers to bridge
    this gap and analyze the impact of various single-cell processes systematically.
    In this review we capture the current state of mathematical and computational approaches,
    emphasizing flexible, mesoscopic models which can be adjusted to describe a wide range of
    biological processes at their respectively required level of detail in order to study a variety
    of collective effects.
    We come to the conclusion that mechanical properties have been investigated extensively while
    other biolgical effects such as extracellular signalling, growth and differentiation are less
    studied.

\section{Biological Principles - sorted}
\subsection{Cellular Properties}

\todo{move this to introduction}
Bacteria, unicellular divers procaryotic organisms and one of the simpler model to study individual single cell morphogenic changes up to emergent spatial emergent phenomena \cite{Vollmer2001}.
Various cell shapes are encountered in the prokaryotic world/Contain cells of different shapes, and yet we know little about how these shapes affect community biology \cite{Smith2017}.

Among the Well-studied examples include rod-shaped bacteria. Including gram negative as well as gram positive bacteria \ac{ecoli} (a Gram-negative bacterium) and \ac{bsubtilis} (Gram-positive) \cite{Chang2014}.

Including gram negative as well as gram positive bacteria \ac{ecoli} (a Gram-negative bacterium) and \ac{bsubtilis} (Gram-positive) \cite{Chang2014}.

\subsubsection{Cell shape}

Here we first present the cell wall and cytoskeletal. Then how they are coupled.

\paragraph{Cell Wall}
\begin{itemize}
    \item points from book: Intracytoplasmic membranes, Membrane structure, Periplasm, Capsule, S-layer (surface layer) \todo{remove when all points have a citation}
    \item \cite{Cava2014} main cell envelope of bacteria is a mesh-like macromolecule of glycan strands that are crosslinked via short peptides. Thus  peptidoglycan \ac{pg}
    \item \cite{vanTeeffelen2018} \ac{pg} PG meshwork mechanically resists the high turgor pressure and gives the cell its specific cell shape
    \item \cite{Cochrane2020} \ac{PG} chemically unique (to bacteria) and essential for cell survival. Therfore it's synthesis and turnover is targeted by a range of antibacterial treatments
    \item \cite{Daniel2003} 2 ways maintaining rod shape: with/without MReB: A few rod-shaped bacteria have no MreB system.
        Different mechanism based on use of polar growth zones derived from the division machinery (\ac{pg} and FtsZ)
    \item \cite{Amir2014} bacterial cell shape is physically determined by the \ac{pg} cell wall but not sufficient for maintaining rod-shape on its own, need more effects \todo{do we need more details from this paper?}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Cytoskeleton}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It was long believed that bacteria lack cytoskeletal filaments but with the end of the last century, it was discovered that the MreB protein fills this role since it "[..] forms an actin-like cytoskeleton in bacteria [..]" \cite{Erickson2001}.
    \item \cite{Dersch2020} It can polymerize and form filaments which behave similar to actin microfilaments 
    \item \cite{Lowe2017_lj} Studies of its crystal structure further showed the similarity to actin~\cite{vandenEnt2001} and the MreB, MreC and MreD proteins were identified as homologues of actin 
    \item \cite{Ausmees2003} extension to point before: Intermediate filaments (IFs) bacterial equivalent to IF proteins, named crescentin
    \item \cite{vanTeeffelen2018} MreB filaments are attracted to regions of negative Gaussian curvature and excluded from regions of positive Gaussian curvature, such as the cell poles, contribtuting to a rod-shape
    \item \cite{Bratton2018} trans-membrane protein RodZ can modulate MreB density. It has a direct effect on MreB curvature preference
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Interplay}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{White2012} \cite{López2006} MreB adopts a spiral-like or banded pattern along the length of the cell coordinating \ac{pg} synthesis  
    \item \cite{Shi2018} MreB is a cytoskeletal organizing element it's localization also directs cell growth to locally change cell shape 
    \item \cite{DEscobar2011} MreB polymers actively restrict and/or control the mobility of cell wall elongation complexes
    \item  \cite{Shi2018} MreB filaments move circumferentially around rods \cite{Garner2021} of any width, resultant \ac{pg} synthesis around the rod circumference is stabilizing rod shape against the internal pressure
    \item \cite{Wang2010, Wang2010_protocol} MreB and \ac{pg} contributes to nearly equal parts to the stiffness of a cell
    \item \cite{Olshausen2013} got good resolution of MreB dynamics with the help of \ac{tirf}. Their mathematical model confirms that MreB acts as mechanical organizer, coupling the cytoskeleton with cell wall synthesis to maintain rod shape.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Growth, Division and Regulation}
Here we first describe how rod-shape bacteria can grow. Further we show how the single machineries contribute in rod shape maintenance/shape lost. Then the division regulation is described. Finally, we give a brief outlook to other forms.

\paragraph{Growth}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{Cooper1991} \cite{Wang2010_2} \ac{pg} synthesis is spatially and temporally regulated. During elongation, cells grow at a constant diameter, expanding surface mainly along the sidewall. During constriction polar synthesis is initiated forming new polar caps
    \item \cite{Chatterjee1988} spatial variation of mechanical stress in the cell also contributes to growth patterns, shape maintenance, and division site selection.
    \item \cite{Chang2014} cell elongation is comparable for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (\ac{bsubtilis} and \ac{ecoli}) despite their wall thickness
    \item \cite{Billaudeau2017} wall thickness influence elongation dynamics (species-specific coordination) (details if needed: in \ac{bsubtilis} and \ac{ecoli} \ac{pg} assembly, spatial pattern, wall thickness, and machinery organization differ, leading to distinct elongation dynamics )
    \item \cite{DePedro2003} new \ac{pg} is inserted in discrete patches along the lateral sidewall
    \item \cite{Billaudeau2017} Growth is MreB-dependent, maintaining constant diameter
    \item \cite{Si2015} Bacterial morphogenesis and \ac{pg} synthesis are mechanically sensitive, showing that growth patterns are adaptive and coupled to physical forces.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Maintaining/Loosing Rod-shape}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{Jones2001} MreB is responsible for cell width regulation and Mbl is responsible for linear axis regulation. Beyond rod-shaped bacteria.
    \item \cite{Lleo1990} shape is balanced by two reaction i) wall elongation ii) septum formation. cocci shaped lost i) or are induced by mutations in i)
    \item e.g. for lacking i): \ac{a22} treated cells \cite{IWAI2002}, \textit{rodZ} deletion mutants \cite{Shiomi2008} and \ac{mre} mutants \cite{Wachi1987} were found to induce spherical cells shape indicating that cell shape maintenance involves proteins encoded by the \ac{mre} like MreB or interacting with them
    \item extension to point before: specifying what \ac{a22} is. \cite{Bean2009} \ac{a22} binds directly to nucleotide-free MreB, due to its high affinity to the nucleotide-binding pocket of MreB. Thereby disrupting MreB assembly
    \item Switch in or \denovo \ac{pg} synthesis is sufficient to regenerate the cell wall and restore a rod-shape morphology \cite{Huan2021} spherical to rod-shape  \cite{Kawai2014} L-form to rod-shape
    \item \cite{Garner2021} MreB filaments move circumferentially around rods of any width, but filament motion was isotropic in spherical cells, moving in all directions\todo{why are we citing this?}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Cell division}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{Bramkamp2009} Two inhibitory systems regulates the assembly FtsZ \cite{Oliva2004}: i) Min system prevents division near poles and ii) nucleoid occlusion prevents cell division over the nucleoids
    \item adding to first point \cite{Koch1995} \cite{Chatterjee1988} central FtsZ-ring assembly is favored by mechanical forces. Its regulation is thereby a combination of mechanical cues and biochemical regulation
    \item FtsZ filaments are forming a ring (Z-ring) at division site \cite{Li2007} generating constriction force for division. The ring tension is regulating \ac{pg} synthesis \cite{Lan2007}
    \item \cite{DenBlaauwen2008} divisome or septosome switches \ac{pg} synthesis from dispersed to a concentrated local to from new cell poles
    \item \cite{Woldringh1987} \cite{Cooper1991} surface synthesis rate increase at the start of constriction, elongation and pole formation use distinct, spatially regulated \ac{pg} insertion modes, supporting the idea of separate elongation and division machineries (divisome/septosome)
    \item \cite{Kruse2005} \cite{Gitai2005} MreB contributes in forming a bacterial mitotic-like machine and control Bacterial DNA segregation
    \item \cite{Karczmarek2007} DNA and origin region segregation are not affected by the transition from rod to sphere after inhibition of Escherichia coli MreB by \ac{a22} \todo{do we really need this extra information?}
    \item \cite{denBlaauwen2018} bacterial morphogenetic is plastic and can be reprogrammed changing growth and division axis \todo{@toqi do we really need this for modelling EMERGENT phenomena?}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Rod-shape vs. other shape}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{Young2006} shape is an evolutionary trait which influence nutrient uptake, cell division and segregation, adhesion, passive and aktive motility, predator avoidance, and cellular differentiation.
    \item e.g. for point before: \cite{Takeuchi2005} changed \ac{ecoli} morphologies without altering any additional biochemical or genetic functions and automatically altered cell motility
    \item Other shapes often request other or additional cell-wall-machineries \cite{Zapun2008} or cytoskeletal components like crescentin which are bacterial equivalent to intermediate filaments (IFs\cite{Ausmees2003}
    \item to conclude: \cite{Jones2001} "We therefore suggest that a sphere is the default shape taken by cells in the absence of an active, mreB-dependent shape determining system, and that more complex shapes are usually determined in part by \textit{mreB} systems". \cite{Young2006} "It can be argued that the earliest cells consisted of "[...] rods and filaments with cocci being
\end{itemize}


\textbf{[Note (Jonas)]} \todo{all citations in this paragraph are also formulated as points}
\paragraph{Cells are flexible/filamentous, not always straight} 
In bacteria the MreB protein forms an actin-like cytoskeleton~\cite{Erickson2001}.
It can polymerize and form filaments which behave similar to actin microfilaments~\cite{Dersch2020}.
The effect of MreB on the shape of cells during growth was shown in more detail
by~\cite{Ursell2014}.
They found that MreB localizes specifically at regions of negative curvature and thus introduces
heterogeneous cell growth which results in a bending force during the growth of cells.
It also means that the cells are able to sense the curvature of the cell wall through cytoskeleteal
MreB filaments during growth.
\cite{Bratton2018} showed that the trans-membrane protein RodZ can modulate MreB density
This feedback mechanism will result in straight rod-shaped bacteria if not interfered from the
external environment.
These results were also confirmed by the studies of~\cite{Wang2010}.
In their experiments, a single bacterium was fixed at the bottom pole while an optically trapped
bead was placed on the upper pole.
They could now exert a force on the free part and thus study the response of the cell under
different conditions.
When treating cells with \ac{a22},~\cite{IWAI2002,Gitai2005,Karczmarek2007,Bean2009}, a higher displacement with identical force could be measured, thus indicating that MreB increases mechanical rigidity of the cell. \todo{@Jonas I do not find this information in those citations? Those citations all have to do with DNA segregation. Which did you mean?}


\textit{In principle, this stress will be dependent on the position inside the cell~\cite{Chatterjee1988}.}
Multiple efforts have been made in recent years to measure and analyze the bending properties of individual bacteria.
\cite{Amir2014_2} designed an experiment similar to \cite{Wang2010,Wang2010_protocol} but instead of optically trapped beads, a flow was used to apply a uniform force on the rod.
Their method is non-invasive and allows for larger force scales.
Cell-division was suppressed with SulA, thus altering the cellular biochemistry.
Since the cells grow continuously, a straight  hape was recovered in every case.
With these methods, they demonstrated that the bacteria "[..] exhibit two fundamentally different modes of deformations and recover from them" \cite{Amir2014_2}.
These modes are elastic in which the cell recovers immediately and plastic which requires growth to restore its morphology.
Short pulses of forces resulted in elastic  eformations from which the cell recovered immediately.
Plastic changes in morphology were only possible under longer periods of persistent force exertion.
Figure X(B) compares the angle  of deflection before and after the snap-back which occurs after turning off the flow.
The linear fit of 66 experimental results under varying conditions shows that both modes contribute to the behaviour of the cells.


\subsubsection{Nutrient uptake/distribution, Movement, pathogens and adaptation} %  Stiffness? here or by shape section?

\paragraph{Nutrient uptake/distribution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{Davies2021, Niederweis2008, Tanaka2018} Bacterial nutrient uptake is mediated by highly selective transporter systems (e.g., ABC transporters, TRAP systems, and PTS) that import sugars, amino acids, ions, carbon, nitrogen, iron, and lipids; bacteria can also modulate cell envelope permeability and secrete enzymes to facilitate nutrient acquisition
    \item \cite{Velicer2009Pred}  \cite{Rory2015} a diverse part of bacterial are predators and found in various environments, plaing a significant role in microbial community structure and dynamics, with different modes of predation and independent evolutionary origins
    \item \cite{Caron1994} Bacteria acquire significant nitrogen and phosphorus from dissolved inorganic nutrients, competing with phytoplankton and influencing the microbial loop; overall contribution to ocean nutrient uptake is poorly understood
    \item \cite{Watteaux2015} Motile chemotactic bacteria have an enhances nutrient uptake rate. 2.2 times faster than non-motile 
    \item \cite{Li2025} matrix-producing improve access to nutrients, supporting growth under nutrient-limited conditions
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Movement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{swimming}
    \item \cite{Shen2022} bending stiffness of the flagellar filament support propulsion and reorientation during swimming, it does not vary
    \item \cite{Kong2014} swimming motion of rod-shaped magnetotactic bacteria is regulated by shape and magnetism
    \item \cite{Alberti1990} swimming cells are short, mononucleate, flagellated for planktonic motility. Can differentiate to swamers, when growing on and surface
    \item \textbf{swarming}
    \item \cite{Harshey1994} swarming is active and rapid surface motility. Swarmer cell is are usually long, multinucleate, hyperflagellated bacterial cell
    \item \cite{Harshey2015} compared to swimming which direct a single through chemotaxis to find nutrients and avoid toxic environments swarming is a collective motion suppressing chemotaxis and using the dynamics of their collective motion to continuously expand and acquire new territory
    \item \textbf{gliding}
    \item \cite{ContrerasM2024} gliding relies on a outer-membrane complex that attaches the substrate at fixed sites of focal adhesion enabling directional gliding motility
    \item \cite{Chang2016}type IV pili generates retraction force for twitching motility, pulling the cell across surfaces (glinding-motion in a collective way)
    \item \cite{Shah2022} model shows that non-Newtonian slime behavior enhances gliding motility by optimizing force transmission and energy use
    \item \cite{Shrivastava2015} \ac{flavo} and \textit{Myxococcus xanthus} are gliding rod-shpaed flagelaten-free spicies. Their gliding relies on rotary motors driving mobile surface filaments, providing continuous propulsion analogous to a snowmobile
    \item \textbf{adhesion}
    \item \cite{BrettFinlay2014, Berne2018} Adhesins, pili/fimbriae, and surface proteins mediate the binding to \ac{ecm} components/ adehsion is a highly heterogeneous and dynamic process
    \item Type IV pili \cite{Ellison2021} or flagella in general \cite{Haiko2013} are more than force-generating structures that coordinate bacterial movement, they play an important role in the direct adhesion, and environmental interaction
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Adaptation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{Bertrand2019} bacteria encountering new nutrients have an adaptive phase: lag-phase in which there is now division. While this dormant stage metabolic adaptation and macromolecular synthesis occur to prepare  for rapid cell growth and robust cell division
    \item \cite{Senkei2007} Bacterial populations exhibit heterogeneous, asynchronous responses in lag times, swimming speeds, or surface motility activation for adaptive advantage
    \item \cite{Barrangou2007} CRISPR provides adaptive resistance against bacteriophages \cite{Duckworth2002} in prokaryotes (\cite{Borges2017} some protein families have anti-CRISPR function)
    \item \cite{Amir2014_2} elastic deformations after pulse-like force do not change the shape permanently. Plastic deformations occur adapting to external bending forces causing the cell walls to grow differentially leading to persisting plastic deformations
    \item \cite{Kim2003, Lai2009} Swarm-cell have elevated resistance to multiple antibiotics
    \item \todo{sporilation and fruiting body}
    \item \cite{Huan2021, Errington2020, Licking2000, Barák2019} a variety of bacteria can form spores in order to survive under unfavorable environmental conditions. Germination, these spores restore vegetative morphology
    \item \cite{Licking2000, Jose2016, Branda2001} certain bacteria from fruiting bodies, a multicellular aggregation of differentiated cells, where spore formation is preferred
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Taxi}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{Krell2011} multiple diverse taxis systems integrating chemical (chemotaxis), light (phototaxis), oxygen (aerotaxis), temperature (thermotaxis), and magnetic fields (magnetotaxis) stimuli. Bacterial taxis are versitle and highly evolutionary adapted to the species environment.
    \item \cite{Nikita2009, Bourret2002} Chemotaxis, is the most common and best studied form of taxis. It is a receptor-mediated signaling network that integrates external chemical cues to modulate flagellar motion and control movement direction.
\end{itemize}

\todo{Sorting following citations into above paragraphs}
Gram-negative bacteria (eg. \ac{ecoli}) express outer membrane proteins (adhesins) which allow them to attach to various hosts \cite{Vaca2019,Beachey1981}.

\todo{Division of task outside of biofilms}

\paragraph{Text from Other paper}
A colony of bacteria is known to form biofilms \cite{Dunne2002}. \todo{Find citation to biofilms only - not specific aspect}. This strategy is beneficial for the
survival of the collective as it allows it to harness growth factors and migrate when necessary and
also is an important issue in bacterial infections in the biomedical sector~\cite{Ong1999}\todo{add specific medical issue paper}.
The formation of biofilms is only possible due to the attractive nature of bacterial interactions
towards each other and surfaces \cite{Berne2018}. To analyze bacterial adhesion to surfaces,
\cite{vanLoosdrecht1989} investigated the interactions of various bacteria with negatively charged
polystyrene.
They found that the interaction is characterized by a low Gibbs energy of $(2 - 3)kT$ per cell
which can be described by a secondary minimum of the DLVO-theory~\cite{Verwey1947,Derjaguin1993}
which is relevant for distances $\geq\SI{1}{\nano\meter}$.
At these distances, the DLVO potential acts as a generic adhesive potential.
Particles which stay in the secondary minimum are held together but even weak interactions are
enough to redisperse them which means that this state is reversible.
When approaching closer distances, more intricate mechanisms come into play in which the
heterogeneity of the materials in question needs to be considered.
\cite{Hori2010} described bacterial adhesion as a “two-phase process including an initial,
instantaneous and reversible physical phase (phase one) and a time-dependent and irreversible
molecular and cellular phase (phase two)”.

\paragraph{Morphologie of biofilm}
The overall attractive nature of the bacterial forces can be seen in the stress response to positive and negative compression of a colony in a confined space.
\cite{Trejo2013} studied the formation of macroscopic wrinkles when growing bacteria in a confined space.
They were able to model the strain and stress of the collection of bacteria which requires that cells are connected by a (to first order) spring-like force.
The developing wrinkles could then be described by a buckling instability.

\paragraph{Adehsion}\todo{Rethink if this is not better with adhesion paragraph?}
All these considerations become even more intricate when interactions between bacteria are considered.
Gram-negative bacteria (eg. E.Coli) express outer membrane proteins (adhesins) which allow them to
attach to various hosts (Beachey 1981, Vaca et al. 2019).
In addition, the flagella can play an important role in the direct adhesion between
cells~\cite{Haiko2013}.
Thus it is not correct to blindly apply the results for adhesion to surfaces to the interactionsbetween bacteria.

\paragraph{Adehsion in biofilms}
\cite{Duvernoy2018} used laser techniques and force microscopy to investigate adhesion of individual \ac{ecoli} and \ac{paeruginosa} cells.
They found that the adhesion forces of the rods are polar, resulting in mechanical tension which in turn determines daughter cell arrangement.
They measured the size of the grown bacterial colonies, fitted ellipses to their shapes and found that adhesion and polar adhesion in particular resulted in a greater difference between the long and short axis of the fitted ellipse and thus a more oval shape rather than circular (WT).
Furthermore, they measured the critical value $N_(2D\/3D)$ where the colony grows into a second layer on top of the base layer.
It was shown by \cite{Grant2014} Figure X B), that the point of transition depends on the rigidity of the surrounding gel and \cite{Duvernoy2018} extended this analysis, showing that the critical value $N_(2D\/3D)$ depends on the adhesive strength and polarity of the interaction.
\cite{Grant2014} described the growing bacterial colony as a disc with radius $R$ which is pressed into the agarose slab.
The authors created a purposely-designed simulation in `C++` in order to model the effects of the gel on the collection of bacteria.
They approximated individual bacteria as multiple overlapping spheres which were linked by nonlinear springs such that their dynamics correspond to the Euler-Bernoulli dynamic beam theory \cite{HAN1999}.
The physical interaction potential between multiple bacteria and the surface was of the form

\begin{equation}
    F(\epsilon) = C E_b (d/2)^(2 - \beta) \epsilon^\beta
\end{equation}

where only repulsive effects were considered and no attractive forces which is justified by the already dense packing of the bacteria in the experiment.
The value $F$ is the magnitude of the force, $E_b$ is the effective Young modulus of the whole bacterium, $epsilon$ is the distance of overlap between two spheres and $d$ the diameter of the spheres.
Their model also accounts for friction between cells which is based on Amonton's laws (against the direction of movement, proportional to the magnitude of the normal force) \cite{Hutchings2021}.
In order to portray growth, new spheres were inserted and cells divided upon reaching a threshold.
In combining all these aspects, the authors have constructed an agent-based model which was able to produce the stacking behaviour they set out to describe.

Although the developing wrinkles mentioned in the preceding section can be characterized as a form of collective self-organization, they require a confined space and would not be observable otherwise.
In most cases, rod-shaped bacteria grow in a medium separated enough such that they can freely extend in space.
\cite{vanGestel2015} explored how \ac{bsubtilis} migrates over a surface by forming multicellular structures.
The cells organize themselves into "van Gogh bundles" of cells which are tightly aligned in chains which then form filamentous loops.
This phenomenon occurs at the border of the bacterial colony and the migration is driven by two phenotypically different cell types \cite{Lpez2010}.
"[The authors] propose that surfactin-producing cells reduce the friction between cells and their substrate, thereby facilitating matrix-producing cells to form bundles" \cite{vanGestel2015}.
It has been shown that mutants which combine \textit{srfA} and \textit{eps} are able to outperform the wild-type when it comes to colony expansion \cite{Velicer2009}.
In their final stage, van Gogh bundles consist only of matrix-producing cells although they depend on surfactin-producing ones during their development.
\cite{vanGestel2015} also constructed an agent-based model to describe the observed effects.
Cells are modeled as straight lines in the shape of a filament by connecting their ends to each other.
They are initially placed horizontally at the bottom of the simulation domain In order to update to the next position, three mechanisms are involved: (1) Cell elongation (2) Cell division (3) Cell turning.
While the first two are rather self-explanatory, in the last step, a new spatial orientation of the cells is chosen in order to minimize the potential energy

\begin{equation}
    V = (\pi - \alpha_1)^2 + (\pi - \alpha_2)^2
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ denote the angles to their respective neighbors.
By choosing the new orientation at random with probability $P=1-e^(k(V_c-V_n))$ (where $V_c,V_n$ are the current and new potential energies), the parameter $k$ symbolizes the bending rigidity.
Their analysis found that a high bending rigidity can play a more important role than the overall cell size, i.e.
the growth rate.
Concerning the complexity of their model, the authors noted: "We did not aim to accurately model the biophysical details of the growth of van Gogh bundles (parameterization of such a model would be impossible), but rather to make a simple phenomenological model to shape our intuition [..]" \cite{vanGestel2015}.
While the authors correctly assessed that the parametrization of such a model with just one particular experiment would be very difficult, multiple sources combined which treat individual aspects of each cellular aspect can yield enough information to meaningfully produce results.
\cite{Dong2022} showed that van Gogh bundles aid in the self-healing of bacterial colonies.
They observed that an artificially introduced cut heals better at lower curvatures, which corresponds to a higher rigidity of the ensemble being placed more towards the outer region of the triangular-shaped cut.
This work served as a precursor for a very recent study by \cite{Li2025} in which they picked up on the Agent-Based model.
Here, they investigated the interplay of nutrient depletion and multiple biofilms on the capacity to form van Gogh bundles.
Their model used linear growth on the cellular level which is only a first-order approximation to the experimentally observed exponential growth discussed previously.
Furthermore, no forces were calculated between the bacteria but a "shoving algorithm" (collision detection) moved the agents around such that collisions were avoided.
Based on the approach of \cite{vanGestel2015} they implemented cell-turning with.
But more significantly, they implemented a reaction-diffusion system

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial C_s}{\partial t} = D_n \nabla C_s + r_n
\end{equation}

where $\nabla$ is the gradient, $D_n$ the diffusion coefficient and $r_n$ is the nutrient sink or source.
More precisely, the nutrient sinks (sources) $r_n$ have to be located at the positions of cells.
If we assume a simplification to a point-like interaction with the external environment, we can write as

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial C_s}{\partial t} = D_n \nabla C_s  + \sum\limits_i u_i r_n (x_i) \delta(x-x_i)
\end{equation}

where the sum ranges over all cells $i=1..$ and each cell might have an individual exchange range $u_i$ located at position $x_i$ which is denoted by the well-known dirac delta-distribution $\delta(x-x_i)$.
The authors compared a single-biofilm system with a multi-biofilm system and showed that motile cells can convert into matrix-producing cells in a nutrient depleted system.
The authors show that spores in the case of a nutrient-depleted system

In order to describe the multicellular systems we looked at in the preceding sections, multiple
different aspects of cellular behaviour and their interactions with the surrounding domain need to
be considered and implemented.
Table \ref{table:simulation-aspects} summarizes these aspects and points to the relevant
experiments.
Aspects (1-5) take place inside the cell, (6,7) correspond to interactions between different
cellular agents and (8,9) to interactions with the domain.
It should be noted explicitly that these simulation aspects can be coupled to each other.
We have already seen such an example in the results of @Takeuchi2005 and @Ursell2014 where the
continued growth modulates the mechanical response of the cell.
Additionally, Aspect (5) is an overarching concept which is relevant for all processes.
Especially for the parameters which facilitate growth, we can assume that there is no direct
inheritance from one generation to the next but only a stochastic distribution of parameters from
which the new value is drawn (see supplement).

\subsection{Computational Modeling Frameworks}

        agent-based models" and update: \cite{Jang2012}
    \item \cite{Rudge2012} CellModeller, has rod-shaped support and some predefined chemical
        reactions etc.
\end{itemize}

Since the beginning of this decade, multiple tools have emerged which are able to describe living
systems on a cellular individual-based approach in various details.
A good reason for choosing a framework over a purpose-built solution is to follow the Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability and Reuse) FAIR principles by \cite{Wilkinson2016}.
These criteria have been designed to improve the overall infrastructure surrounding (re)usability of
scholarly data and methods.
In our previous work, we investigated their differences and features and capacity to model
individual behaviour of cells \cite{Pleyer2023}.
Using one of these existing toolkits means that already existing functionality can be used to
develop own models and the produced research results can be fed back to the library for fellow
researchers to reuse.
This begs the question, which of these existing models is able to support the long list of aspects
that we set out to describe with the experimentally gathered evidence.

\paragraph{Many general-purpose Frameworks lack explicit support for Rod-Shaped Bacteria}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{Ghaffarizadeh2018} PhysiCell; no rods
    \item \cite{Swat2012} CompuCell; uses \ac{cpm}; no rods
    \item \cite{Cooper2020} Chaste; cell-centre and vertex-based; no rods
    \item \cite{Starru2014} Morpheus, uses \ac{cpm}; no rods
    \item \cite{Wei2013} BNSim; cells are spheres
\end{itemize}

Of the most popular frameworks, most do not support rod-shaped bacteria out of the box.
The very popular Cellular Potts Model (CPM) \cite{Graner1992} is mostly applied in 2D and only
represents cells as lattice grid points.
Since CompuCell3D \cite{Swat2012} exclusively builds upon the CPM, it can not model rod-shaped
bacteria.
PhysiCell \cite{Ghaffarizadeh2018} was designed to answer questions surrounding cancer research and
currently only supports spherical agents.
Chaste \cite{Cooper2020} was also designed for cancer research but further targets the heart and
tissues.
Naturally its Agent-Based Model supports cell-centre and vertex-based models but no rod shapes.
Morpheus \cite{Starru2014} also employs the CPM along with other spatial representations such as
vertex-based models or PDEs but has no support for Rod-Shaped bacteria.
Even purpose-built solutions such as BNSim \cite{Wei2013} which specifically targets bacterial
networks, assumes a simplified spherical representation for their bacterial agents.

\paragraph{Varying Support for Rod-Shaped Bacteria}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{example-image-a}
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{example-image-b}
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{example-image-c}
    \caption{TODO: Snapshots of Modeling Frameworks}
\end{figure}

As we have seen, many frameworks do not provide existing functionality for rod-shaped bacteria.
However, some others do have various levels of support.
Biocellion \cite{Kang2014} can model agents with cylindrical interaction potentials but does not
model any of the MreB-related bending and rigidity or polar interactions.
They acknowledge this shortcoming: "Mapping a cell to multiple agents is also necessary to
separately model subcellular compartments [..].
However, Biocellion does not yet support this." \cite{Kang2014}
BSim2.0 represents cells as rigid capsular cells made from a cylindrical center part and two
half-spheres, which are placed at the ends of the cylinder to round out the shape.
In order to calculate interactions between cells, possible overlaps are determined and minimized,
thus determining the position values of the next iteration step.
It also accounts for many other phenomena, which are displayed in \textbf{TODO replace}.
BSim does not consider bending forces for individual cells or polar interactions.
The \texttt{gro} programming language was designed to simulate the growth of colonies and cell-cell
communication.
Its "physics computation has been optimized for rigid rod-shaped bodies, like E. coli bacteria"
\cite{Gutirrez2017}.
They recognize two types of forces which are acting on the cellular agents:
\textit{Local forces} which are calculated between adjacent bacteria and a \textit{global force}
which pushes bacteria outwards of the colony.
The latter of these is a phenomenological implementation of the observed colony expansion and the
associated central pressure with it.
This assumption may yield incorrect results for sparsely populated cases.
The engine is limited to 2D and does not consider polar interactions or bending of the rods.

\subsection{Inheritance of Growth-Relevant Parameters}

We consider a distribution of parameters $rho(x)$ for
which the rate of proliferation of any cell is proportional to the value of the parameter $x$.
The rate of proliferation and thus the rate with which $rho(x)$ changes is given by
$partial_rho(x,t) x = lambda rho(x,t) x$.
This Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is trivially solvable with solution

\begin{equation}
    \rho(x,t) = \rho(x,t_0) \exp(\lambda t x)
\end{equation}

For the simple example of a Gaussian distribution
$\rho(x,t_0) = 1/\sqrt{2 pi \sigma^2} \exp(-x^2/(2 \sigma^2))$, we can calculate the expectation
value for the parameter $x$ via

\begin{align}
    E[x(t)]
    &= 1/\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2} \int \rho(x,t) x op("dx")\\
    &= 1/\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2} \int x \exp{-x^2/(2 \sigma^2} + \lambda t x) op("dx")\\
    % &= 1/sqrt(2 pi sigma^2) integral x exp( -(x - lambda sigma^2 t)^2/(2 sigma^2) - lambda^2 sigma^2 t^2) op("dx")\
    % &= 1/sqrt(2 pi sigma^2) integral x exp( -(x - lambda sigma^2 t)^2/(2 sigma^2) + (lambda^2 sigma^2 t^2) /2) op("dx")\
    % &= 1/sqrt(2 pi sigma^2) integral [- sigma^2 partial/(partial x) +lambda sigma^2 t] exp( -(x - lambda sigma^2 t)^2/(2 sigma^2))exp((lambda^2 sigma^2 t^2) /2) op("dx")\
    % &= 1/sqrt(2 pi sigma^2) integral lambda sigma^2 t exp( -(x - lambda sigma^2 t)^2/(2 sigma^2))exp((lambda^2 sigma^2 t^2) /2) op("dx")\
    &= \lambda \sigma^2 t \exp{(\lambda^2 \sigma^2 t^2)/2}.
\end{align}

We can see that the expected value $E[x(t)]$ keeps increasing faster than regular exponential growth
and indefinitely which is contrary to observation (see Figure \textbf{TODO}) and intuition.
The same qualitative result will emerge for different distributions.
With these considerations, we can assume that the new parameters of freshly divided cells are drawn
from a random distribution which carries no temporal correlation between the mother and daughter
cell. (TODO this should be provable more rigorously)
It has to be stated explicitly that these considerations were done under the assumption that the
proliferation of the cell is affected and proportional to the value of the parameter.
