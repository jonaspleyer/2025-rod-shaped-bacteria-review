abstract = {Summary Swarming is a form of active surface motility that is widespread among flagellated. Gram–negative bacteria. In the laboratory, growth of the bacteria on certain agar surfaces leads to induction of the differentiated swarmer-cell state. Swarmer cells are generally long and multinucleate, always hyperflagellated, and can move rapidly over the agar surface in a coordinated manner. Some swarm colonies exude large amounts of ‘slime’, which could be essential for promoting intimate cell–cell contacts during swarming. There is evidence that the differentiated swarmer-cell stage facilitates pathogenic associations with host tissue. Almost nothing is known about the molecular signalling mechanism of surface sensing. Increased viscosity appears to be sensed by several bacteria, but other environmental cues, specific to each bacterium, are also important. In organisms in which swarming motility has been studied in some detail, the chemotaxis system has been shown to play an important rote. The recent discovery of swarming motility in two genetically well-characterized organisms –Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium– should lead to rapid progress in understanding this process.},

However, more recent studies of other bacterial species revealed a significant diversity in the chemotaxis mechanisms which are reviewed here. Differences include the genomic abundance, size and topology of chemoreceptors, the mode of signal binding, the presence of additional cytoplasmic signal transduction proteins or the motor mechanism. This diversity of chemotactic mechanisms is partly due to the diverse nature of input signals. However, the physiological reasons for the majority of differences in the taxis systems are poorly understood and its elucidation represents a major research need.},

abstract = {The uptake of nutrients, including metals, amino acids and peptides are required for many biological processes. Pathogenic bacteria scavenge these essential nutrients from microenvironments to survive within the host. Pathogens must utilize a myriad of mechanisms to acquire these essential nutrients from the host while mediating the effects of toxicity. Bacteria utilize several transport proteins, including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters to import and expel substrates. ABC transporters, conserved across all organisms, are powered by the energy from ATP to move substrates across cellular membranes. In this review, we will focus on nutrient uptake, the role of ABC importers at the host–pathogen interface, and explore emerging therapies to combat pathogenesis.

abstract = {In this study, we use direct numerical simulations (DNS) to investigate the response of chemotactic bacteria to an isolated patch of chemoattractant in a turbulent environment. Previous work has shown that by stirring nutrients that are chemoattractants into a network of thin, elongated filaments, turbulence directly influences the rate at which chemotactic bacteria consume nutrients. However, the quantitative outcome of this process is influenced by a host of physical and biological factors, and many of these remain unexplored. Here, we analyse the sensitivity of nutrient uptake by chemotactic bacteria on a wide range of physical and biological parameters using a series of controlled DNS. Starting with uniformly distributed populations of motile and non-motile bacteria in a fully developed homogeneous, isotropic turbulent flow, we inject a patch of dissolved nutrients. We then assess the chemotactic advantage, defined as the difference between the nutrients consumed by motile and non-motile bacteria over the lifetime of the patch. We find that the chemotaxis can enhance the total uptake rate by a factor of 1.6 and allows the population of chemotactic bacteria to absorb nutrients 2.2 times faster than non-motile bacteria Results show that chemotactic bacteria are subject to a trade-off between swimming to leave regions devoid of nutrients and, once a nutrient gradient is detected, staying in regions of large nutrient concentration. These findings could help explain how the physical characteristics of turbulent marine ecosystems influence the optimal biological traits of bacteria through the competition for limited resources.}

   abstract = "The growth and nutritional requirements of mycobacteria have been intensively studied since the discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis more than a century ago. However, the identity of many transporters for essential nutrients of M. tuberculosis and other mycobacteria is still unknown despite a wealth of genomic data and the availability of sophisticated genetic tools. Recently, considerable progress has been made in recognizing that two lipid permeability barriers have to be overcome in order for a nutrient molecule to reach the cytoplasm of mycobacteria. Uptake processes are discussed by comparing M. tuberculosis with Mycobacterium smegmatis. For example, M. tuberculosis has only five recognizable carbohydrate transporters in the inner membrane, while M. smegmatis has 28 such transporters at its disposal. The specificities of inner-membrane transporters for sulfate, phosphate and some amino acids have been determined. Outer-membrane channel proteins in both organisms are thought to contribute to nutrient uptake. In particular, the Msp porins have been shown to be required for uptake of carbohydrates, amino acids and phosphate by M. smegmatis. The set of porins also appears to be different for M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis. These differences likely reflect the lifestyles of these mycobacteria and the availability of nutrients in their natural habitats: the soil and the human body. The comprehensive identification and the biochemical and structural characterization of the nutrient transporters of M. tuberculosis will not only promote our understanding of the physiology of this important human pathogen, but might also be exploited to improve tuberculosis chemotherapy.",

   abstract = "Bacteria and archaea use CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems to defend themselves from infection by bacteriophages (phages). These RNA-guided nucleases are powerful weapons in the fight against foreign DNA, such as phages and plasmids, as well as a revolutionary gene editing tool. Phages are not passive bystanders in their interactions with CRISPR-Cas systems, however; recent discoveries have described phage genes that inhibit CRISPR-Cas function. More than 20 protein families, previously of unknown function, have been ascribed anti-CRISPR function. Here, we discuss how these CRISPR-Cas inhibitors were discovered and their modes of action were elucidated. We also consider the potential impact of anti-CRISPRs on bacterial and phage evolution. Finally, we speculate about the future of this field.",
